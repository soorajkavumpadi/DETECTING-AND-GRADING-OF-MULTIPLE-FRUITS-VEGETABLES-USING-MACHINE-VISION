# DETECTING-AND-GRADING-OF-MULTIPLE-FRUITS-VEGETABLES-USING-MACHINE-VISION
Agriculture stands at the pinnacle of food and health. Traditional grading of fruits and vegetables remains ineffective due to various reasons. This type of grading proves to be a difficult task due to the mass production of fruits and vegetables. Rise in technological advancements in the field of agriculture can help increase productivity and reduce selling of damaged or defective products. Machine vision could be used in this field of grading of fruit/vegetables. We propose a real-time fruit and vegetable grading system using Machine Vision to help all users to choose the ideal fruit or vegetable for consumption effectively by providing shelf life and grade of fruit. An Android phone is used to scan the fruit or vegetable in real-time. The features of the objects are extracted, and the data is processed. The chemical ripening in the fruit/vegetable is also detected. To create a cost-effective, portable, accurate, and real-time grading application for fruits and vegetables using Machine Vision. The system is accurate up to 70% in real time and 96 percent for our own dataset, according to our results.
